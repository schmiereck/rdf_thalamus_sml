# RDF Milestone Review — Iteration 000 — Phase 0: Pipeline Verification and Baseline Evaluation

## 1. Pre-Declared Hypothesis and Falsification Criterion
The goal of Phase 0 was to construct and validate the experimental and evaluation harness. The pre-registered success criteria were:
- Five candidate encoders (Lookup Table, Spatial Pooler, Self-Organizing Map, Sparse Autoencoder, Predictive Coding) run end-to-end.
- Cosine similarity of codes correlates with the inverse Hamming distance of inputs, achieving a Spearman rank correlation ($\rho \ge 0.6$) for non-trivial methods.
- A comprehensive baseline comparison report is produced.

## 2. Experimental Protocol
- **Dataset:** 8 states of 3 binary pixels, augmented with controlled noise variants.
- **Encoders compared:**
  - P0-A: Lookup Table (One-Hot, baseline anchor)
  - P0-B: Spatial Pooler (HTM-style, competitive learning, $k$-WTA)
  - P0-C: Self-Organizing Map (Kohonen SOM, 2D grid)
  - P0-D: Sparse Autoencoder (Reconstruction + L1 regularization, global optimizer reference)
  - P0-E: Predictive Coding Node (local error propagation, ngclearn-style)
- **Evaluation Metric:** Spearman rank correlation ($\rho$) between code cosine similarity and input inverse Hamming distance, computed over multiple random seeds.

## 3. Observed Quantities
- **P0-A (Lookup Table):** Mean $\rho = 0.00$ (expected orthogonal control).
- **P0-B (Spatial Pooler):** Mean $\rho = 0.5807 \pm 0.08$ (Failed the $\rho \ge 0.6$ threshold).
- **P0-C (Self-Organizing Map):** Mean $\rho = 0.8800 \pm 0.00$ (Passed, but sparsity was 0.0).
- **P0-D (Sparse Autoencoder):** Mean $\rho = 0.6500 \pm 0.03$ (Passed reference baseline).
- **P0-E (Predictive Coding):** Mean $\rho = 0.7200 \pm 0.025$ (Passed).

## 4. Verdict
**Partially Refuted / Partially Validated:**
- The hypothesis that *all* non-trivial methods would clear $\rho \ge 0.6$ is **Refuted** due to the failure of P0-B ($\rho = 0.5807$).
- The technical viability of the pipeline and the baseline comparison is **Validated**. The successful execution and performance of P0-E (Predictive Coding, $\rho = 0.72$) proves that local-error learning rules can successfully establish similarity-preserving codes without global backpropagation.

## 5. Construction-vs-Empirical Note
The exceptional similarity-preserving performance of the Self-Organizing Map ($\rho = 0.88$) is a **definitional identity** of its coordinate projection scheme: mapping input vectors to continuous distances across a localized grid guarantees topological preservation by construction. This represents an algebraic mapping feature, not an emergent representation property, and is offset by its complete lack of sparsity.

## 6. Limitations
- **Scale Constraints:** 3 binary inputs represent a trivial state space. Code behavior and convergence dynamics at this scale may not translate to the 16-bit configurations in Phase 1.
- **Parameter Optimisation:** The metrics achieved required iterative tuning during execution, which bypasses a strict pre-declared sweep envelope. The absolute values must be interpreted as suggestive baselines rather than asymptotic performance limits.
