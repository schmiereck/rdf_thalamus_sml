# Research Manager Journal & Strategic State

## 1. High-Level Strategy & Trajectory
*   **Current Phase:** Phase 1 — Spatial Hierarchy without Time
*   **Active Direction:** Evaluating stacked configurations of the validated encoders (Sparse AE baseline, Predictive Coding, and SOM) in a multi-layer setup with strict recursability (`dim_out = dim_in`) and cross-layer weight sharing.
*   **Confidence Score:** 85% (Harness validated, local learning viability confirmed via Predictive Coding).

## 2. Strategic Insights & Lessons Learned
*   **The Sparsity-Similarity Trade-Off (Definitional Identity):** Phase 0 revealed that the Self-Organizing Map (P0-C) achieved the highest Spearman correlation ($\rho = 0.88$) by representing codes as dense vectors of distances to all grid units. This is a structural property of dense continuous mappings, not an emergent discovery. It directly conflicts with the project's goal of *sparse* universal nodes.
*   **Ultra-Low Dimension Degeneracy (P0-B Failure):** The Spatial Pooler (P0-B) failed the pre-registered metric ($\rho = 0.5807 < 0.6$). In ultra-low-dimensional spaces (3-bit input), competitive $k$-WTA mechanisms are prone to code collisions and quantization noise, making them unsuitable for extremely small scales without fine-grained parameter tuning.
*   **Predictive Coding Feasibility:** The Predictive Coding node (P0-E) cleared the gate ($\rho = 0.72$) using strictly local error signals. This provides a strong, scientifically sound foundation for stacking local-error nodes in Phase 1.

## 3. Loop & Bottleneck Detection
*   **Iterative Tuning Vulnerability:** There is a risk of post-hoc parameter tuning to force models to meet criteria. For Phase 1, we must declare the hyperparameter sweep envelope *before* training to maintain strict parameter-tuning hygiene (Gate 3).
*   **Representation Collapse in Stacking:** In Phase 1, forcing `dim_out = dim_in` may lead to rapid representation decay or trivial constant codes across layers. We must implement a identity-preservation control run.

## 4. Alternate Research Paths
*   **Continuous-Output SOMs:** If pure sparsity terms in Sparse AEs or Predictive Coding completely collapse representation expressivity in stacked layers, we will explore "soft-sparse" SOM-like topologies where the spatial coordinates are mapped to sparse localized Gaussian activations.
